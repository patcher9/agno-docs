## Run your Agent Api locally

`cd` into the `agent-api` folder

```bash
cd agent-api
```

Start your Agent Api using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
ag infra up
```

```bash shorthand
ag infra up dev:docker
```

```bash full options
ag infra up --env dev --infra docker
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few seconds for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

- Open localhost:8000/docs to view the FastAPI routes.

Notes:

- The `Agents` are defined in the `agents` folder.
- The api routes are defined in the `api` folder.
