## Run your Agent Infra Docker locally

`cd` into the `agent-infra-docker` directory

```bash
cd agent-infra-docker
```

Start your Agent Infra Docker using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
ag infra up
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm using Docker Compose, and give it a few seconds for the Docker image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the Docker dashboard.

- Open localhost:7777/docs to view the FastAPI routes for the AgentOS instance.
- Open localhost:5432 to view the PostgreSQL database.

## Stop Agent Infra Docker

Play around with the AgentOS and stop it using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
ag infra down
```

</CodeGroup>
