title: Cancel Agent Run
---

This example demonstrates how to cancel a running agent execution using multi-threading, showing how to start a long-running task and cancel it from another thread.

## Code

```python cancel_a_run.py
"""
Example demonstrating how to cancel a running agent execution.

This example shows how to:
1. Start an agent run in a separate thread
2. Cancel the run from another thread
3. Handle the cancelled response
