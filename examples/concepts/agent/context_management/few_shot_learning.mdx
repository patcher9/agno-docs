    . Check your email for the reset link
    . Follow the link to create a new password

    ),
    Message(
        role="assistant",
        content="""
    I sincerely apologize for the billing error and the frustration this has caused you.

    **Immediate Action Plan:**
    1. I'll investigate your account to confirm the duplicate charge
    2. Process a full refund for the duplicate transaction
    3. Ensure this doesn't happen again by checking your payment method settings
    4. Provide you with a confirmation number once the refund is processed

    The refund typically takes 3-5 business days to appear on your statement. As an apology for this inconvenience, I'd also like to offer you a 10% discount on your next order.

    Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this issue?

    Message(role="user", content="Your app keeps crashing when I try to upload photos"),
    Message(
        role="assistant",
        content="""
    I'm sorry you're experiencing crashes with photo uploads. Let me help you troubleshoot this issue.

    **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    1. **Check App Version:** Ensure you have the latest version from the app store
    2. **Restart the App:** Close completely and reopen the application
    3. **Check Storage:** Make sure you have sufficient device storage (at least 1GB free)
    4. **Photo Size:** Try uploading smaller photos (under 10MB each)
    5. **Network Connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection

    **If the issue persists:**
    - Try uploading one photo at a time instead of multiple
    - Clear the app cache in your device settings
    - Restart your device

    If none of these steps resolve the issue, please let me know your device type and OS version, and I'll escalate this to our technical team for further investigation.
