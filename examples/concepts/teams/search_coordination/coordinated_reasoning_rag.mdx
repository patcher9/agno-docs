## Code

```python cookbook/examples/teams/search_coordination/02_coordinated_reasoning_rag.py
"""
This example demonstrates how multiple specialized agents coordinate to provide
comprehensive RAG responses with distributed reasoning capabilities. Each agent
has specific reasoning responsibilities to ensure thorough analysis.

Team Composition:
- Information Gatherer: Searches knowledge base and gathers raw information
- Reasoning Analyst: Applies logical reasoning to analyze gathered information
- Evidence Evaluator: Evaluates evidence quality and identifies gaps
- Response Coordinator: Synthesizes everything into a final reasoned response

Setup:
1. Run: `pip install agno anthropic cohere lancedb tantivy sqlalchemy`
2. Export your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and CO_API_KEY
3. Run this script to see coordinated reasoning RAG in action
