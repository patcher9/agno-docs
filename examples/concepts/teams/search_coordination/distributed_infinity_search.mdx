This example demonstrates how multiple agents coordinate to perform distributed search using Infinity reranker for high-performance ranking across team members.

## Code

```python cookbook/examples/teams/search_coordination/03_distributed_infinity_search.py
"""
This example demonstrates how multiple agents coordinate to perform distributed
search using Infinity reranker for high-performance ranking across team members.

Team Composition:
- Primary Searcher: Performs initial broad search with infinity reranking
- Secondary Searcher: Performs targeted search on specific topics
- Cross-Reference Validator: Validates information across different sources
- Result Synthesizer: Combines and ranks all results for final response

Setup:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install agno anthropic infinity-client lancedb`
2. Set up Infinity Server:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install "infinity-emb[all]"
   infinity_emb v2 --model-id BAAI/bge-reranker-base --port 7997
   \`\`\`
3. Export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
4. Run this script
