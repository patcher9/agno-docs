title: "Coordinated Agentic RAG Team"
---

This example demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can coordinate to provide comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by dividing search and analysis tasks across team members.

## Code

```python cookbook/examples/teams/search_coordination/01_coordinated_agentic_rag.py
"""
This example demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can coordinate to provide
comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by dividing search
and analysis tasks across team members.

Team Composition:
- Knowledge Searcher: Searches knowledge base for relevant information
- Content Analyzer: Analyzes and synthesizes retrieved content
- Response Synthesizer: Creates final comprehensive response with sources

Setup:
1. Run: `pip install agno anthropic cohere lancedb tantivy sqlalchemy`
2. Export your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and CO_API_KEY
3. Run this script to see coordinated RAG in action
