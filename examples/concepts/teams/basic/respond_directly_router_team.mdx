title: Router Team with Direct Response
sidebarTitle: Router Team
---

This example demonstrates a team of AI agents working together to answer questions in different languages.

The team consists of six specialized agents:
1. **English Agent** - Can only answer in English
2. **Japanese Agent** - Can only answer in Japanese
3. **Chinese Agent** - Can only answer in Chinese
4. **Spanish Agent** - Can only answer in Spanish
5. **French Agent** - Can only answer in French
6. **German Agent** - Can only answer in German

The team leader routes the user's question to the appropriate language agent. With `respond_directly=True`, the selected agent responds directly without the team leader processing the response.
