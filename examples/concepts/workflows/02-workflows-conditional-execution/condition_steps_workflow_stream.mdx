title: Condition steps workflow
description: This example demonstrates how to use conditional steps in a workflow.
---

This example demonstrates **Workflows 2.0** conditional execution pattern. Shows how to conditionally execute steps based on content analysis,
providing intelligent selection of steps based on the actual data being processed.

**When to use**: When you need intelligent selection of steps based on content analysis rather than
simple input parameters or some other business logic. Ideal for quality gates, content-specific processing, or
adaptive workflows that respond to intermediate results.
