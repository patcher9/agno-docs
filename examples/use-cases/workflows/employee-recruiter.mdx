Employee Recruitment Workflow with Simulated Tools

This workflow automates the complete employee recruitment process from resume screening
to interview scheduling and email communication. It demonstrates a multi-agent system
working together to handle different aspects of the hiring pipeline.

Workflow Overview:
1. **Resume Screening**: Analyzes candidate resumes against job requirements and scores them
2. **Interview Scheduling**: Schedules interviews for qualified candidates (score >= 5.0)
3. **Email Communication**: Sends professional interview invitation emails

Key Features:
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses specialized agents for screening, scheduling, and email writing
- **Async Streaming**: Provides real-time feedback during execution
- **Simulated Tools**: Uses mock Zoom scheduling and email sending for demonstration
- **Resume Processing**: Extracts text from PDF resumes via URLs
- **Structured Responses**: Uses Pydantic models for type-safe data handling
- **Session State**: Caches resume content to avoid re-processing

Agents:
- **Screening Agent**: Evaluates candidates and provides scores/feedback
- **Scheduler Agent**: Creates interview appointments with realistic time slots
- **Email Writer Agent**: Composes professional interview invitation emails
- **Email Sender Agent**: Handles email delivery (simulated)

Usage:
    python employee_recruiter_async_stream.py

Input Parameters:
- message: Instructions for the recruitment process
- candidate_resume_urls: List of PDF resume URLs to process
- job_description: The job posting requirements and details

Output:
- Streaming updates on each phase of the recruitment process
- Candidate screening results with scores and feedback
- Interview scheduling confirmations
- Email delivery confirmations

Note: This workflow uses simulated tools for Zoom scheduling and email sending
to demonstrate the concept, you can use the real tools in practice.
