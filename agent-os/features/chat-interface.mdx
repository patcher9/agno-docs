## Overview

The AgentOS chat is the home for day‑to‑day work with your AI system. From one screen you can:

- Chat with individual agents
- Collaborate with agent teams
- Trigger and monitor workflows
- Review sessions, knowledge, memory, and metrics

It’s designed to feel familiar—type a message, attach files, and get live, streaming responses. Each agent, team, and workflow maintains its own context so you can switch between tasks without losing your place.

## Chat Interfaces

### Chat with an Agent

- Select an agent from the right panel.
- Ask a question like “What tools do you have access to?”
- Agents keep their own history, tools, and instructions; switching agents won’t mix contexts.

  memory, and advanced features in our [Agents
  Documentation](/concepts/agents/overview).

### Work with a Team

- Switch the top toggle to Teams and pick a team.
- A team delegates tasks to its members and synthesizes their responses into a cohesive response.
- Use the chat stream to watch how the team divides and solves the task.

### Run a Workflow

- Switch to Workflows and choose one.
- Provide the input (plain text or structured, depending on the workflow).
- Watch execution live: steps stream as they start, produce output, and finish.

## Troubleshooting

- The page loads but nothing responds: verify your AgentOS app is running.
- Can’t see previous chats: you may be in a new session—open the Sessions panel and pick an older one.
- File didn’t attach: try a common format (png, jpg, pdf, csv, docx, txt, mp3, mp4) and keep size reasonable.
