The `Agent.run()` function runs the agent and generates a response, either as a `RunOutput` object or a stream of `RunOutputEvent` objects.

## Running Agents

### Basic Execution

Here's how to run your agent. The response is captured in the `response`.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent, RunOutput
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response: RunOutput = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")

# Print the response in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

<Tip>
  You can also run the agent asynchronously using the `Agent.arun()` method. See
  the [Async Agent](/examples/concepts/agent/async/basic) example.
</Tip>

### Run Input

The `input` parameter is the input to send to the agent. It can be a string, a list, a dictionary, a message, a pydantic model or a list of messages.

For example:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    description="You write movie scripts.",
)

response = agent.run("Write movie script about a girl living in New York")
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

<Tip>
  The `pprint_run_response` utility is a helper function that prints the
  response on your terminal.
</Tip>

For more information, and to see how to use structured input and output with agents, see the [Input & Output](/concepts/agents/input-output) documentation.

### Run Output

The `Agent.run()` function returns a `RunOutput` object when not streaming. Here are some of the core attributes:

- `run_id`: The id of the run.
- `agent_id`: The id of the agent.
- `agent_name`: The name of the agent.
- `session_id`: The id of the session.
- `user_id`: The id of the user.
- `content`: The response content.
- `content_type`: The type of content. In the case of structured output, this will be the class name of the pydantic model.
- `reasoning_content`: The reasoning content.
- `messages`: The list of messages sent to the model.
- `metrics`: The metrics of the run. For more details see [Metrics](/concepts/agents/metrics).
- `model`: The model used for the run.

See detailed documentation in the [RunOutput](/reference/agents/run-response) documentation.

## Streaming Responses

To enable streaming, set `stream=True` when calling `run()`. This will return an iterator of `RunOutputEvent` objects instead of a single response.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunOutputEvent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a stream
response_stream: Iterator[RunOutputEvent] = agent.run(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion",
    stream=True
)

# Print the response stream in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response_stream, markdown=True)
```

<Tip>
  You can also run the agent asynchronously using the `Agent.arun()` method. See
  the [Async Agent Streaming](/examples/concepts/agent/async/streaming) example.
</Tip>

### Streaming Intermediate Steps

For even more detailed streaming, you can enable intermediate steps by setting `stream_intermediate_steps=True`. This will provide real-time updates about the agent's internal processes.

```python
# Stream with intermediate steps
response_stream: Iterator[RunOutputEvent] = agent.run(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion",
    stream=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True
)
```

### Handling Events

You can process events as they arrive by iterating over the response stream:

```python
response_stream = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion", stream=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)

for event in response_stream:
    if event.event == "RunContent":
        print(f"Content: {event.content}")
    elif event.event == "ToolCallStarted":
        print(f"Tool call started: {event.tool}")
    elif event.event == "ReasoningStep":
        print(f"Reasoning step: {event.content}")
    ...
```

You can see this behavior in action in the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com/chat/agents).

### Storing Events

You can store all the events that happened during a run on the `RunOutput` object.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), store_events=True)

response = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion", stream=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)
pprint_run_response(response)

for event in response.events:
    print(event.event)
```

By default the `RunContentEvent` event is not stored (because it would be very verbose). You can modify which events are skipped by setting the `events_to_skip` parameter.

For example:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.run.agent import RunEvent

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"), store_events=True, events_to_skip=[RunEvent.run_started])
```

### Event Types

The following events are yielded by the `Agent.run()` and `Agent.arun()` functions depending on the agent's configuration:

| `OutputModelResponseCompleted` | Signals completion of the output model response  |

### Custom Events

If you are using your own custom tools, it will often be useful to be able to yield custom events. Your custom events will be yielded together with the rest of the expected Agno events.

We recommend creating your custom event class extending the built-in `CustomEvent` class:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from agno.run.agent import CustomEvent

@dataclass
class CustomerProfileEvent(CustomEvent):
    """CustomEvent for customer profile."""

    customer_name: Optional[str] = None
    customer_email: Optional[str] = None
    customer_phone: Optional[str] = None
```

You can then yield your custom event from your tool. The event will be handled internally as an Agno event, and you will be able to access it in the same way you would access any other Agno event.

```python
from agno.tools import tool

@tool()
async def get_customer_profile():
    """Example custom tool that simply yields a custom event."""

    yield CustomerProfileEvent(
        customer_name="John Doe",
        customer_email="john.doe@example.com",
        customer_phone="1234567890",
    )
```

See the [full example](/examples/concepts/agent/events/custom_events) for more details.

## Options When Running an Agent

### Specify the User and Session

You can specify which user and session to use when running the agent by passing the `user_id` and `session_id` parameters. This ensures the current run is associated with the correct user and session.

For example:

```python
agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot", user_id="john@example.com", session_id="session_123")
```

For more information see the [Agent Sessions](/concepts/agents/sessions) documentation.

### Passing Images / Audio / Video / Files

You can pass images, audio, video, or files to the agent by passing the `images`, `audio`, `video`, or `files` parameters.

For example:

```python
agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about this image", images=[Image(url="https://example.com/image.jpg")])
```

For more information see the [Multimodal Agents](/concepts/multimodal) documentation.

### Pausing and Continuing a Run

An agent run can be paused when a human-in-the-loop flow is initiated. You can then continue the execution of the agent by calling the `Agent.continue_run()` method.

See more details in the [Human-in-the-Loop](/concepts/hitl) documentation.

### Cancelling a Run

A run can be cancelled by calling the `Agent.cancel_run()` method.

See more details in the [Cancelling a Run](/concepts/agents/run-cancel) documentation.
