**Agents are AI programs where a language model controls the flow of execution.**

The core of an Agent is a model using tools in a loop, guided by instructions:

- **Model:** controls the flow of execution. It decides whether to reason, act or respond.
- **Instructions:** program the Agent, teaching it how to use tools and respond.
- **Tools:** enable an Agent to take actions and interact with external systems.

Agents also have memory, knowledge, storage and the ability to reason:

- **Memory:** gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn and improve their responses.
- **Storage:** is used by Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage makes Agents stateful, enabling multi-turn conversations.
- **Knowledge:** is domain-specific information the Agent can **search at runtime** to provide better responses (RAG). Knowledge is stored in a vector database and this search at runtime pattern is known as **Agentic RAG** or **Agentic Search**.
- **Reasoning:** enables Agents to "think" before responding and "analyze" the results of their actions before responding, this improves reliability and quality of responses.
