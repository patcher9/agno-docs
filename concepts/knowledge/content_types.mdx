Agno Knowledge uses `content` as the building block of any piece of knowledge.
Content can be added to knowledge from different sources.

| Content Origin   | Description                                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Path             | Local files or directories containing files                                |
| Url              | Direct links to files or other sites                                       |
| Text             | Raw text content                                                           |
| Topic            | Search topics from repositories like Arxiv or Wikipedia                    |
| Remote Content   | Content stored in remote repositories like S3 or Google Cloud Storage      |

Knowledge content needs to be read and chunked before it can be passed to any VectorDB for embedding, storage and ultimately, retrieval.
When content is added to Knowledge, a default reader is selected. Readers are used to parse content from the origin and then chunk it into smaller
pieces that will then be embedded by the VectorDB. 

Custom readers or an override to the default reader and/or its settings can be passed when adding the content. In the below example, an instance of the standard `PDFReader` class is created
but we update the chunk_size. Similarly, we can update the `chunking_strategy` and other parameters that will influence how content is ingested and processed.

```python 
from agno.knowledge.reader.pdf_reader import PDFReader

reader = PDFReader(
    chunk_size=1000,
)

knowledge_base = Knowledge(
    vector_db=vector_db,
)

asyncio.run(
        knowledge_base.add_content_async(
            path="data/pdf",
            reader=reader
        )
    )
```
