description: Learn how to use DeepSeek models in Agno.

DeepSeek is a platform for providing endpoints for Large Language models.
See their library of models [here](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing).

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `deepseek-chat` model is good for most basic use-cases.
- `deepseek-reasoner` model is good for complex reasoning and multi-step tasks.

DeepSeek does not have rate limits. See their [docs](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/rate_limit) for information about how to deal with slower responses during high traffic.

## Authentication

Set your `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable. Get your key from [here](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx DEEPSEEK_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `DeepSeek` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.deepseek import DeepSeek

agent = Agent(model=DeepSeek(id="deepseek-chat"), markdown=True)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")

```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

| Parameter    | Type               | Default                                        | Description                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | `str`              | `"deepseek-chat"`                              | The id of the DeepSeek model to use                                  |
| `name`       | `str`              | `"DeepSeek"`                                   | The name of the model                                                 |
| `provider`   | `str`              | `"DeepSeek"`                                   | The provider of the model                                             |
| `api_key`    | `Optional[str]`    | `None`                                         | The API key for DeepSeek (defaults to DEEPSEEK_API_KEY env var)      |
| `base_url`   | `str`              | `"https://api.deepseek.com"`                   | The base URL for the DeepSeek API                                     |

`DeepSeek` extends the OpenAI-compatible interface and supports most parameters from the [OpenAI model](/concepts/models/openai).

**Note**: DeepSeek's support for structured outputs is currently not fully compatible, so `supports_native_structured_outputs` is set to `False`.

## Available Models

- `deepseek-chat` - General-purpose conversational model, good for most use cases
- `deepseek-reasoner` - Advanced reasoning model optimized for complex problem-solving and multi-step tasks
