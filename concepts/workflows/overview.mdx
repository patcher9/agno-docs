description: Learn how Agno Workflows enable deterministic, controlled automation of multi-agent systems
---

Agno Workflows enable you to build deterministic, controlled agentic flows by orchestrating agents, teams, and functions through a series of defined steps. Unlike free-form agent interactions, workflows provide structured automation with predictable execution patterns, making them ideal for production systems that require reliable, repeatable processes.

## Why should you use Workflows?

Workflows provide deterministic control over your agentic systems, enabling you to build reliable automation that executes consistently every time. They're essential when you need:

**Deterministic Execution**

- Predictable step-by-step processing with defined inputs and outputs
- Consistent results across multiple runs
- Clear audit trails for production systems

**Complex Orchestration**

- Multi-agent coordination with controlled handoffs
- Parallel processing and conditional branching
- Loop structures for iterative tasks

Workflows excel at **deterministic agent automation**, while [Teams](/concepts/teams/overview) are designed for **dynamic agentic coordination**. Use workflows when you need predictable, repeatable processes; use teams when you need flexible, collaborative problem-solving.

## Deterministic Step Execution

Workflows execute as a controlled sequence of steps, where each step produces deterministic outputs that feed into the next step. This creates predictable data flows and consistent results, unlike free-form agent conversations.

**Step Types**

- **Agents**: Individual AI executors with specific capabilities and instructions
- **Teams**: Coordinated groups of agents working together on complex problems
- **Functions**: Custom Python functions for specialized processing logic

**Deterministic Benefits**
Your agents and teams retain their individual characteristics and capabilities, but now operate within a structured framework that ensures:

- **Predictable execution**: Steps run in defined order with controlled inputs/outputs
- **Repeatable results**: Same inputs produce consistent outputs across runs
- **Clear data flow**: Output from each step explicitly becomes input for the next
- **Controlled state**: Session management and state persistence between steps
- **Reliable error handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error recovery
