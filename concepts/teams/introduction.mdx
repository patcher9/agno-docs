A Team is a collection of Agents (or other sub-teams) that work together to accomplish tasks.

A `Team` has a list of `members` that can be instances of either `Agent` or `Team`.

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.agent import Agent

team = Team(members=[
    Agent(name="Agent 1", role="You answer questions in English"),
    Agent(name="Agent 2", role="You answer questions in Chinese"),
    Team(name="Team 1", role="You answer questions in French"),
])
```

The team leader delegates tasks to members depending on the role of the members and the nature of the tasks.

As with agents, teams support the following features:

- **Model:** Set the model that is used by the "team leader" to delegate tasks to the team members.
- **Instructions:** Instruct the team leader on how to solve problems. The names, descriptions and roles of team members are automatically provided to the team leader.
- **Tools:** If the team leader needs to be able to use tools directly, you can add tools to the team.
- **Reasoning:** Enables the team leader to "think" before responding or delegating tasks to team members, and "analyze" the results of team members' responses.
- **Knowledge:** If the team needs to search for information, you can add a knowledge base to the team. This is accessible to the team leader.
- **Storage:** The Team's session history and state is stored in a database. This enables your team to continue conversations from where they left off, enabling multi-turn, long-term conversations.
- **Memory:** Gives Teams the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.

<Tip>
  It is recommended to specify the `name` and the `role` fields of each team
  member, for better identification by the team leader.
