When we call `Team.run()`, it creates a stateless, singular Team run.

But what if we want to continue this conversation i.e. have a multi-turn conversation? That's where "Sessions" come in. A session is collection of consecutive runs.

In practice, a session in the context of a Team is a multi-turn conversation between a user and the Team. Using a `session_id`, we can connect the conversation history and state across multiple runs.

See more details in the [Agent Sessions](/concepts/agents/sessions) documentation.

## Multi-user, multi-session Teams

Each user that is interacting with a Team gets a unique set of sessions and you can have multiple users interacting with the same Team at the same time.

Set a `user_id` to connect a user to their sessions with the Team.

In the example below, we set a `session_id` to demo how to have multi-turn conversations with multiple users at the same time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Multi-user, multi-session example">
    ```python
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db")

    team = Team(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        members=[
            Agent(name="Agent 1", role="You answer questions in English"),
            Agent(name="Agent 2", role="You answer questions in Chinese"),
            Agent(name="Agent 3", role="You answer questions in French"),
        ],
        db=db,
        respond_directly=True,
    )

    user_1_id = "user_101"
    user_2_id = "user_102"

    user_1_session_id = "session_101"
    user_2_session_id = "session_102"

    # Start the session with user 1 (This means "how are you?" in French)
    team.print_response(
        "comment Ã§a va?",
        user_id=user_1_id,
        session_id=user_1_session_id,
    )
    # Continue the session with user 1 (This means "tell me a joke" in French)
    team.print_response("Raconte-moi une blague.", user_id=user_1_id, session_id=user_1_session_id)

    # Start the session with user 2
    team.print_response("Tell me about quantum physics.", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)
    # Continue the session with user 2
    team.print_response("What is the speed of light?", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)

    # Ask the agent to give a summary of the conversation, this will use the history from the previous messages (but only for user 1)
    team.print_response(
        "Give me a summary of our conversation.",
        user_id=user_2_id,
        session_id=user_2_session_id,
    )
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install agno openai
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python multi_user_multi_session.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session Summaries

The Team can store a condensed representations of the session, useful when chat histories gets too long. This is called a "Session Summary" in Agno.

To enable session summaries, set `enable_session_summaries=True` on the `Team`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Session summary example">
    ```python session_summary.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.models.google.gemini import Gemini
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

    db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db")

    user_id = "jon_hamm@example.com"
    session_id = "1001"

    team = Team(
        model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.0-flash-001"),
        members=[
            Agent(name="Agent 1", role="You answer questions in English"),
            Agent(name="Agent 2", role="You answer questions in Chinese"),
        ],
        db=db,
        enable_session_summaries=True,
    )

    team.print_response(
        "What can you tell me about quantum computing?",
        stream=True,
        user_id=user_id,
        session_id=session_id,
    )

    team.print_response(
        "I would also like to know about LLMs?",
        stream=True,
        user_id=user_id,
        session_id=session_id
    )

    session_summary = team.get_session_summary(session_id=session_id)
    print(f"Session summary: {session_summary.summary}")
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install google-genai agno
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python session_summary.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Customize Session Summaries

You can adjust the session summaries by providing a custom `session_summary_prompt` to the `Team`.

The `SessionSummaryManager` class is responsible for handling the model used to create and update session summaries.
You can adjust it to personalize how summaries are created and updated:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customize session summaries example">
    ```python customize_session_summary.py
    from agno.team import Team
    from agno.session import SessionSummaryManager
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

    # Setup your database
    db = SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db")

    # Setup your Session Summary Manager, to adjust how summaries are created
    session_summary_manager = SessionSummaryManager(
        # Select the model used for session summary creation and updates. If not specified, the agent's model is used by default.
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        # You can also overwrite the prompt used for session summary creation
        session_summary_prompt="Create a very succinct summary of the following conversation:",
    )

    # Now provide the adjusted Memory Manager to your Agent
    team = Team(
      members=[],
      db=db,
      session_summary_manager=session_summary_manager,
      enable_session_summaries=True,
    )

    team.print_response("What is the speed of light?", stream=True)

    session_summary = team.get_session_summary()
    print(f"Session summary: {session_summary.summary}")
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install openai agno
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python customize_session_summary.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session history

Teams with storage enabled automatically have access to the message and run history of the session.

You can access these messages using:

- `agent.get_messages_for_session()` -> Gets access to all the messages for the session, for the current agent.
- `agent.get_chat_history()` -> Gets access to all the unique messages for the session.

We can give the Agent access to the chat history in the following ways:

- We can set `add_history_to_context=True` and `num_history_runs=5` to add the messages from the last 5 runs automatically to every message sent to the agent.
- We can set `read_chat_history=True` to provide a `get_chat_history()` tool to your agent allowing it to read any message in the entire chat history.
- **We recommend setting all 3: `add_history_to_context=True`, `num_history_runs=3` and `read_chat_history=True` for the best experience.**
- We can also set `read_tool_call_history=True` to provide a `get_tool_call_history()` tool to your agent allowing it to read tool calls in reverse chronological order.

Take a look at this example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Session history example">
    ```python session_history.py
    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.google.gemini import Gemini
    from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

    agent = Agent(
        model=Gemini(id="gemini-2.0-flash-exp"),
        db=SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db"),
        add_history_to_context=True,
        num_history_runs=3,
        read_chat_history=True,
        description="You are a helpful assistant that always responds in a polite, upbeat and positive manner.",
    )

    agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story", stream=True)

    agent.print_response("What was my first message?", stream=True)
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install google-genai agno
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python session_history.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Search the session history

In some scenarios, you might want to fetch messages from across multiple sessions to provide context or continuity in conversations.

To enable fetching messages from the last N sessions, you need to use the following flags:

- `search_session_history`: Set this to `True` to allow searching through previous sessions.
- `num_history_sessions`: Specify the number of past sessions to include in the search. In the example below, it is set to `2` to include only the last 2 sessions.

It's advisable to keep this number low (2 or 3), as a larger number might fill up the context length of the model, potentially leading to performance issues.

Here's an example of searching through the last 2 sessions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Session history search example">
  ```python session_history_search.py
  import os
  from agno.agent import Agent
  from agno.team import Team
  from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
  from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

  if os.path.exists("tmp/data.db"):
     os.remove("tmp/data.db")

  db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/data.db")

  team = Team(
      members=[],
      model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
      user_id="user_1",
      db=db,
      search_session_history=True,  # allow searching previous sessions
      num_history_sessions=2,  # only include the last 2 sessions in the search to avoid context length issues
  )

  session_1_id = "session_1_id"
  session_2_id = "session_2_id"
  session_3_id = "session_3_id"
  session_4_id = "session_4_id"
  session_5_id = "session_5_id"

  team.print_response("What is the capital of South Africa?", session_id=session_1_id)
  team.print_response("What is the capital of China?", session_id=session_2_id)
  team.print_response("What is the capital of France?", session_id=session_3_id)
  team.print_response("What is the capital of Japan?", session_id=session_4_id)
  team.print_response(
      "What did I discuss in my previous conversations?", session_id=session_5_id
  )  # It should only include information from the last 2 sessions
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the example">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install openai agno
    ```

    Export your key
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx
    ```

    Run the example

    ```shell
    python session_history_search.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Control what gets stored in the session

As your sessions grow, you may want to decide what data exactly is persisted. Agno provides three flags to optimize storage while maintaining full functionality during execution:

- **`store_media`** - Controls storage of images, videos, audio, and files
- **`store_tool_messages`** - Controls storage of tool calls and their results  
- **`store_history_messages`** - Controls storage of history messages

<Tip>
### How it works

These flags only affect what gets **persisted to the database**. During execution, all data remains available to your team - media, tool results, and history are still accessible in the `RunOutput` object. The data is scrubbed right before saving to the database.

This means:
- Your team functionality remains unchanged
- Tools can access all data they need during execution
- Only the database storage is optimized
