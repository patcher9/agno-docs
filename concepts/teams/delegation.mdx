sidebarTitle: Delegate tasks to members
description: Teams can delegate tasks to members in different ways.
---

A `Team` internally has a team-leader agent that delegates tasks to the members.  When you call `run` or `arun` on a team, the team leader agent uses a model to determine which member to delegate the task to.

The basic flow is:
1. The team receives user input
2. A Team Leader analyzes the input and decides how to break it down into subtasks
3. The Team Leader delegates specific tasks to appropriate team members
4. Team members complete their assigned tasks and return their results
5. The Team Leader synthesizes all outputs into a final, cohesive response

Below are some examples of how to change the behaviour of how tasks are delegated to the members.

## Determine input for members

When a team is run, by default the team leader will determine the "task" to give a specific member. This then becomes the `input` when that member is run.

If you set `determine_input_for_members` to `False`, the team leader will send the user-provided input directly to the member agent(s).  The team leader still determines the appropriate member to delegate the task to.

<Tip>
This feature is particularly useful when you have specialized agents with distinct expertise areas and want to automatically direct queries to the right specialist.
</Tip>

In the example below, we want to send stuctured pydantic input directly to the member agent.  We don't want the team leader to ingest this input and determine a task to give to the member agent.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Team">
    Create a file `determine_input_for_members.py`

    ```python determine_input_for_members.py
    from typing import List

    from agno.agent import Agent
    from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
    from agno.team.team import Team
    from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


    class ResearchTopic(BaseModel):
        """Structured research topic with specific requirements."""

        topic: str = Field(description="The main research topic")
        focus_areas: List[str] = Field(description="Specific areas to focus on")
        target_audience: str = Field(description="Who this research is for")
        sources_required: int = Field(description="Number of sources needed", default=5)


    # Create specialized Hacker News research agent
    hackernews_agent = Agent(
        name="Hackernews Agent",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        tools=[HackerNewsTools()],
        role="Extract key insights and content from Hackernews posts",
        instructions=[
            "Search Hacker News for relevant articles and discussions",
            "Extract key insights and summarize findings",
            "Focus on high-quality, well-discussed posts",
        ],
    )

    # Create collaborative research team
    team = Team(
        name="Hackernews Research Team",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
        members=[hackernews_agent],
        determine_input_for_members=False,  # The member gets the input directly, without the team leader synthesizing it
        instructions=[
            "Conduct thorough research based on the structured input",
            "Address all focus areas mentioned in the research topic",
            "Tailor the research to the specified target audience",
            "Provide the requested number of sources",
        ],
        show_members_responses=True,
    )

    # Use Pydantic model as structured input
    research_request = ResearchTopic(
        topic="AI Agent Frameworks",
        focus_areas=["AI Agents", "Framework Design", "Developer Tools", "Open Source"],
        target_audience="Software Developers and AI Engineers",
        sources_required=7,
    )
    # Execute research with structured input
    team.print_response(input=research_request)
    ```
    </Step>
  <Step title="Run the team">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install openai agno
    ```

    Run the team

    ```shell
    python determine_input_for_members.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Respond directly

During normal team execution, the team leader will process the responses from the members and return a single response to the user.

If instead you want to return the response of members directly, you can set `respond_directly` to `True`.

<Tip>
It can make sense to use this feature in combination with `determine_input_for_members=False`.

<Note>
This is not compatible with `delegate_task_to_all_members`.
</Note>

## Delegate task to all members

When you set `delegate_task_to_all_members` to `True`, the team leader will delegate the task to all members simultaneously, instead of one by one.  When running async (using `arun`) members will run concurrently.
