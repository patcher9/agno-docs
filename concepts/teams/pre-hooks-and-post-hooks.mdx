Pre-hooks and post-hooks are a simple way to validate or modify the input and output of an Team run.


## Pre-hooks

Pre-hooks execute **before** your Team processes the input, giving you complete control over what reaches the LLM.

They're perfect for implementing validation, security checks, or any data preprocessing task against the input your Team receives.

### Common Use Cases

**Input Validation**
- Validate format, length, content or any other property of the input.
- Remove or mask sensitive information.
- Normalize input data.

**Data Preprocessing**
- Transform input format or structure.
- Enrich input with additional context.
- Apply any other business logic before sending the input to the LLM.

### Basic Example

Let's create a very simple pre-hook that validates the input length and raises an error if it's too long:

```python
from agno.team import Team
from agno.exceptions import CheckTrigger, InputCheckError

# Simple function we will use as a pre-hook
def validate_input_length(
    run_input: RunInput,
    session: TeamSession,
    user_id: Optional[str] = None,
    debug_mode: Optional[bool] = None,
) -> None:
    """Pre-hook to validate input length."""
    max_length = 1000
    if len(run_input.input_content) > max_length:
        raise InputCheckError(
            f"Input too long. Max {max_length} characters allowed",
            check_trigger=CheckTrigger.INPUT_NOT_ALLOWED,
        )

team = Team(
    name="My Team",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    # Provide the pre-hook to the Team using the pre_hooks parameter
    pre_hooks=[validate_input_length],
)

You can see some complete examples of pre-hooks in the [Examples](/examples/concepts/teams/pre-hooks-and-post-hooks) section.

## Pre-hooks Parameters

Pre-hooks run automatically during the Team run. Some parameters will be injected automatically.

You can learn more about the parameters in the [Pre-hooks](/reference/hooks/pre-hooks) reference.

## Post-hooks

Post-hooks execute **after** your Team generates a response, allowing you to validate, transform, or enrich the output before it reaches the user.

They're perfect to handle output filtering, compliance checks, or any other output transformation you need.

### Common Use Cases

**Output Validation**
- Validate response format, length, and content quality.
- Remove sensitive or inappropriate information from responses.
- Ensure compliance with business rules and regulations.

**Output Transformation**
- Add metadata or additional context to responses.
- Transform output format for different clients or use cases.
- Implement any other output transformation you need.

### Basic Example

Let's create a simple post-hook that validates the output length and raises an error if it's too long:

```python
from agno.exceptions import CheckTrigger, OutputCheckError
from agno.run.team import RunOutput

# Simple function we will use as a post-hook
def validate_output_length(run_output: RunOutput) -> None:
    """Post-hook to validate output length."""
    max_length = 1000
    if len(run_output.content) > max_length:
        raise OutputCheckError(
            f"Output too long. Max {max_length} characters allowed",
            check_trigger=CheckTrigger.INPUT_NOT_ALLOWED,
        )

team = Team(
    name="My Team",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5-mini"),
    # Provide the post-hook to the Team using the post_hooks parameter
    post_hooks=[validate_output_length],
)
```

You can see some complete examples of post-hooks in the [Examples](/examples/concepts/teams/hooks) section.

## Post-hooks Parameters

Post-hooks run automatically during the Team run. Some parameters will be injected automatically.

You can learn more about the parameters in the [Post-hooks](/reference/hooks/post-hooks) reference.

## Guardrails

A popular use case for pre-hooks are Guardrails: built-in safeguards for your Teams.

You can learn more about them in the [Guardrails](/concepts/teams/guardrails) section.
