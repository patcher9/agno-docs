# How to Build a Scalable Social Media Intelligence Agent with Agno

Create a professional, production-ready social media intelligence system that continuously monitors X (Twitter), performs advanced sentiment analysis, and generates actionable executive intelligence reports for brand and competitor monitoring.

## Overview

In this guide, you will build a multi-agent intelligence pipeline using:

- **Agno** - Orchestrates modular, scalable agent workflows with built-in tool integration
- **X Tools** - Provides real-time, structured data directly from Twitter/X API with engagement metrics  
- **Exa** - Delivers semantic web search for broader context discovery across blogs, forums, and news
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Performs contextually-aware sentiment analysis and strategic pattern detection
- **Python 3.8+** - Chosen for mature async libraries, rich ecosystem, and developer productivity

**Why this architecture?** This system combines direct social media data with broader web intelligence to provide comprehensive brand monitoring that captures both immediate social sentiment and emerging discussions before they reach mainstream attention.

## What You'll Build

Your social media intelligence system will:

- Track brand and competitor mentions across X and the broader web
- Perform weighted sentiment analysis that accounts for influence and engagement
- Detect viral content, controversy signals, and high-influence discussions  
- Generate executive-ready reports with strategic recommendations
- Provide continuous monitoring with configurable alert thresholds
- Suggest context-specific response strategies for different scenarios

## Prerequisites

**Why these requirements?** A controlled environment prevents dependency conflicts while ensuring access to all necessary APIs for comprehensive social media intelligence.

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your machine
- **X (Twitter) Developer Account** with API v2 access - [Apply here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)
- **OpenAI API Key** for GPT-4 access - [Get your key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Exa API Key** for semantic search - [Sign up here](https://exa.ai)
- **Basic Python knowledge** including async programming concepts
- **Git** for version control

## Step 1: Project Setup

**Why isolation matters:** Virtual environments prevent dependency conflicts and ensure reproducible builds across different development machines.

```bash
mkdir social-media-intelligence
cd social-media-intelligence
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Create and activate an isolated Python environment.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

**Why these specific packages?** Each dependency serves a critical role in the intelligence pipeline - Agno for agent orchestration, specific tool integrations for data access, and utility libraries for environment management.

```bash
pip install agno[tools] openai exa_py python-dotenv schedule
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Install required packages and create dependency lockfile.

**Dependency breakdown:**
- `agno[tools]` - Core framework with X and Exa tool integrations
- `openai` - GPT-4 API access for advanced analysis
- `exa_py` - Semantic web search capabilities  
- `python-dotenv` - Secure environment variable management
- `schedule` - Task scheduling for continuous monitoring

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

**Why environment-based configuration?** Keeps API credentials secure, enables environment-specific settings, and prevents accidental credential exposure in version control.

```bash
touch .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

Create environment file and exclude from version control.

Add your API credentials to `.env`:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here

# X (Twitter) API Configuration
X_API_KEY=your-x-api-key
X_API_SECRET=your-x-api-secret
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-access-token-secret
X_BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token

# Exa API Configuration
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-api-key

# Agno Configuration
AGNO_TELEMETRY=false
```

Configure API access for all integrated services.

## Step 4: Create the Intelligence Agent

**Why this agent architecture?** Centralizes all intelligence logic while leveraging Agno's built-in tool orchestration and OpenAI's advanced reasoning capabilities for nuanced sentiment analysis.

```bash
touch social_media_agent.py
```

Create your main intelligence agent:

```python social_media_agent.py
"""Social Media Intelligence Agent

Provides enterprise-grade social media monitoring and analysis,
transforming raw social data into actionable business intelligence.
"""

from social_media_agent import analyze_brand_sentiment

class SocialMediaMonitor:
    """
    Why this approach: Provides flexible monitoring with configurable intervals
    and error handling to ensure continuous operation.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, brands_to_monitor: list):
        self.brands = brands_to_monitor
        
    def run_analysis(self, brand: str):
        """Execute analysis with error handling and logging."""
        print(f"[{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}] Analyzing: {brand}")
        
        try:
            analyze_brand_sentiment(brand, tweet_count=20)
            print(f"✓ Analysis completed for {brand}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"✗ Error analyzing {brand}: {str(e)}")
    
    def schedule_monitoring(self):
        """Set up recurring analysis schedule."""
        for brand in self.brands:
            # Standard monitoring every 2 hours
            schedule.every(2).hours.do(self.run_analysis, brand=brand)
            
        print(f"Monitoring scheduled for: {', '.join(self.brands)}")
        print("Starting continuous monitoring... (Press Ctrl+C to stop)")
        
        try:
            while True:
                schedule.run_pending()
                time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\\nMonitoring stopped by user")
    
    def manual_analysis(self, brand: str = None):
        """Execute immediate analysis on demand."""
        brands_to_analyze = [brand] if brand else self.brands
        
        for target_brand in brands_to_analyze:
            self.run_analysis(target_brand)

# Configuration
MONITORED_BRANDS = [
    "Agno OR AgnoAGI",
    # Add your brands here
]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor = SocialMediaMonitor(MONITORED_BRANDS)
    
    # Run immediate analysis
    print("Running immediate analysis...")
    monitor.manual_analysis()
    
    # Uncomment to start continuous monitoring
    # monitor.schedule_monitoring()
```

Monitoring system with scheduling and error handling.
