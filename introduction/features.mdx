Agno is built for real-world **Agent Engineering**, helping engineers build, deploy, and scale multi-agent systems in production. Here are some key features that make Agno stand out:

### Core Intelligence

- **Model Agnostic**: Works with any model provider so you can use your favorite LLMs.

- **Type Safe**: Enforce structured I/O through `input_schema` and `output_schema` for predictable, composable behavior.

- **Dynamic Context Engineering**: Inject variables, state, and retrieved data on the fly into context. Perfect for dependency-driven agents.

### Memory, Knowledge, and Persistence

- **Persistent Storage**: Give your Agents, Teams, and Workflows a database to persist session history, state, and messages.

- **User Memory**: Built-in memory system that allows Agents to recall user-specific context across sessions.

- **Agentic RAG**: Connect to 20+ vector stores (called **Knowledge** in Agno) with hybrid search + reranking out of the box.

- **Culture (Collective Memory)**: Shared knowledge that compounds across agents and time.

### Execution & Control

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Native support for confirmations, manual overrides, and external tool execution.

- **Guardrails**: Built-in safeguards for validation, security, and prompt protection.

- **Agent Lifecycle Hooks**: Pre- and post-hooks to validate or transform inputs and outputs.

- **MCP Integration**: First-class support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect Agents with external systems.

- **Toolkits**: 113+ built-in toolkits with thousands of tools — ready for use across domains like data, code, web, and enterprise APIs.

### Runtime & Evaluation

- **Runtime**: Pre-built FastAPI based runtime with SSE compatible endpoints, ready for production on day 1.

- **Control Plane (UI)**: Integrated interface to visualize, monitor, and debug agent activity in real time.

- **Natively Multimodal**: Agents can process and generate text, images, audio, video, and files.

- **Evals**: Measure your Agents' Accuracy, Performance, and Reliability.

### Security & Privacy

- **Private by Design**: Runs entirely in your cloud. The UI connects directly to your AgentOS from your browser — no data is ever sent externally.

- **Data Governance**: Your data lives securely in your Agent database, with no external data sharing or vendor lock-in.

- **Access Control**: Role-based access (RBAC) and per-agent permissions to protect sensitive contexts and tools.

Every part of Agno is built for real-world deployment, where developer experience meets production performance.
