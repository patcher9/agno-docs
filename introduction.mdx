Agno is the fastest python framework for building agents with memory, knowledge, human in the loop and MCP support. You can put agents together as multi-agent teams or step-based agentic workflows.

Agno's real advantage is its [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction) runtime:

1. You get a pre-built FastAPI app for running your agents, teams and workflows, meaning you start building your AI product on day one. This is a remarkable advantage over other solutions.
2. You also get a UI that connects directly to your FastAPI app. Use it to test, monitor and manage your system. This gives you unmatched visibility and control.
3. Your AgentOS runs in your cloud and you get complete privacy because no data ever leaves your system. This is incredible for security conscious enterprises that can't send data to external services.

For organizations building agents, Agno provides the complete solution. You get the fastest framework for building agents (speed of development and execution), a pre-built FastAPI app that gets you building product on day one, and a control plane for managing your system.

We bring a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it from your browser. You don't need to send data to any external services or pay retention costs, you get complete privacy and control.

## Getting started

If you're new to Agno, follow the [quickstart](/introduction/quickstart) to build your first Agent and run it using the AgentOS.

After that, checkout the [examples gallery](/examples/introduction) and build real-world applications with Agno.
