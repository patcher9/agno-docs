Agno gives you the fastest framework for building agents with memory, knowledge, session management, human in the loop and best-in-class MCP support. You can put agents together as autonomous multi-agent teams, or build step-based agentic workflows for full control over complex processes.

The real advantage of Agno is its [AgentOS](/agent-os/introduction) runtime:

1. You get a pre-built FastAPI app for running your agentic system and start building your product on day one. This is a remarkable advantage.
2. You also get a control plane which connects directly to your AgentOS for testing, monitoring and managing your system. This gives you unmatched visibility and control over your system.
3. Your AgentOS runs in your cloud and you get complete data privacy because no data ever leaves your system. This is incredible for security conscious enterprises that can't send traces to external services.

For organizations building agents, Agno provides the complete solution. You get the fastest framework for building agents (speed of development and execution), a pre-built FastAPI app that lets you build your product on day one, and a control plane for managing your system.

We bring a novel architecture that no other framework provides, your AgentOS runs securely in your cloud, and the control plane connects directly to it from your browser. You don't need to send data to external services or pay retention costs, you get complete privacy and control.

## Getting started

If you're new to Agno, follow the [quickstart](/introduction/quickstart) to build your first Agent and run it using the AgentOS.

After that, checkout the [examples gallery](/examples/introduction) and build real-world applications with Agno.
