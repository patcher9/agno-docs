title: Route
description: In **Route Mode**, the Team Leader directs user queries to the most appropriate team member based on the content of the request.

The Team Leader acts as a smart router, analyzing the query and selecting the best-suited agent to handle it. The member's response is then returned directly to the user.

## How Route Mode Works

In "route" mode:

1. The team receives a user query
2. A Team Leader analyzes the query to determine which team member has the right expertise
3. The query is forwarded to the selected team member
4. The response from the team member is returned directly to the user

This mode is particularly useful when you have specialized agents with distinct expertise areas and want to automatically direct queries to the right specialist.
